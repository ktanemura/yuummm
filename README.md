An Android app for indecisive eaters.

This app recommends locations to eat at the push of a button!  For when the gang all says that "I don't care" or "I don't know"
when trying to decide where to head for lunch.  Includes options to share the address with friends, call to make reservations, and
get directions all conveniently in the app!

Allows the user to set search options including:
- Location Radius
- Cuisine Type
- Price Range
- Availability

Utilizes the Yelp RESTful API using Retrofit.
